## ðŸ’» About 

 The Quotes Management application is a React.js project developed with the purpose of practicing front-end development using the framework. The main goal of the application is to offer a way for the user to search and register quotes, giving the quote itself and its author. There's also a comments section, where users would be able to express what they think about the registered quotes. The app is using Firebase as a dumb Rest API, to be able to fetch stored quotes and also register new ones.
